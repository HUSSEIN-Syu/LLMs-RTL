# LLM RTL

LLM RTL is a UserScript which modifies the interface of ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Qwen and ClaudeAI to fix the direction of RTL (right-to-left) languages, such as Persian, Hebrew, and Arabic. It ensures that text elements containing RTL languages are displayed correctly from right to left.

## Installation

1. Install a UserScript manager extension for your browser. (Example: Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey)
2. [Click here to install the LLM RTL UserScript](https://github.com/HUSSEIN-Syu/LLMs-RTL/blob/main/LLMs-RTL.user.js).
   - If the installation doesn't start automatically, you can right-click the link, select "Save Link As...", and save the file with a `.user.js` extension.
3. Follow the instructions provided by your UserScript manager to install the UserScript.

## Usage

Once the UserScript is installed, it will automatically run on the LLM websites. It will detect RTL text and modify the corresponding elements to display the text correctly from right to left.
